# Auto-Updater Fixes for Pro Backup

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Code Signature Validation Error
**Problem**: `Code signature at URL file:///... did not pass validation: code has no resources but signature indicates they must be present`

**Solutions Applied**:
- Added `process.env.ELECTRON_UPDATER_ALLOW_UNSIGNED = 'true'` to disable signature verification
- Updated `package.json` build config to disable Mac code signing:
  - `"identity": null`
  - `"gatekeeperAssess": false`
  - `"hardenedRuntime": false`
- Updated `forge.config.js` to disable signing: `osxSign: false`

### 2. Network Connection Issues
**Problem**: "Please check your internet connection and try again later"

**Solutions Applied**:
- Added network connectivity check before attempting updates
- Improved error handling for different network scenarios
- Added specific handling for offline states
- Better error messages for users

### 3. Repository Configuration Mismatch
**Problem**: Wrong repository settings in forge.config.js

**Solutions Applied**:
- Fixed repository owner/name in forge.config.js
- Updated from `bikiran/bikiran` to `its-yeasin/7160EL-Pro-Backup`
- Set `draft: false` to allow public releases

## Files Modified

1. **src/main.js**
   - Added unsigned build support
   - Improved network connectivity checking
   - Enhanced error handling for signature issues
   - Better user feedback for different error scenarios

2. **package.json**
   - Added Mac build configuration to disable signing
   - Added new build scripts for unsigned releases

3. **forge.config.js**
   - Fixed repository configuration
   - Disabled code signing to prevent validation errors
   - Updated publisher settings

4. **scripts/build-unsigned.sh** (NEW)
   - Script to build unsigned releases
   - Sets proper environment variables

## Recommended Actions

### For Immediate Fix:
1. Use the unsigned build: `npm run build:mac:unsigned`
2. Distribute via direct download instead of auto-update until proper signing is set up

### For Production (Long-term):
1. **Set up proper code signing**:
   - Get an Apple Developer account
   - Generate certificates
   - Configure proper signing in electron-builder

2. **Enable notarization**:
   - Required for macOS 10.15+ distribution
   - Prevents security warnings

3. **Update build scripts**:
   - Use `npm run release:unsigned` for testing
   - Use proper signed builds for production releases

## Testing the Fix

1. Build unsigned version: `npm run build:mac:unsigned`
2. Test the app - signature errors should be resolved
3. The "restart now" function should work without signature validation errors

## Notes

- Unsigned builds will show security warnings when first opened
- Users need to right-click â†’ Open to bypass Gatekeeper
- For production, consider setting up proper Apple Developer signing
- The app will now gracefully handle network issues during update checks
